## 🚀 SYNOPSIS

The `minishell` project at 42 school immerses students in the dynamic world of UNIX shell development within the C language. This comprehensive undertaking requires a deep understanding of system calls, process management, and parsing techniques.

Students are tasked with crafting a minimalistic shell that mimics the fundamental functionalities of a UNIX command-line interface.

Beyond basic command execution, minishell delves into advanced features such as environment variable handling, signal management, and piping. Leveraging knowledge in lexical analysis and parsing, students navigate the intricacies of command interpretation and user interaction.

This project, interwoven with the philosophy of simplicity and efficiency, not only sharpens skills in system-level programming but also imparts a practical understanding of the core components that constitute a fully functional shell.
